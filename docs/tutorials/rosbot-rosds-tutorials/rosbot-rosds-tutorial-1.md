How to make a robot move around an indoor area, following a fixed path, while avoiding unexpected obstacles?

In this Live-Class provided by [ROSDS](http://www.theconstructsim.com/), you'll learn how to create a ROS program that uses the ROS Navigation stack to make a robot patrol an area!

Patrolling means that the robot is going to move around an area making a kind of fixed path. This can be very useful for tasks of security inspection, stock analysis or cleaning spaces. In those cases, the robot usually has to move in a fixed path everyday while it is doing at the same time another task (for example, in the case of security inspection, the robot has to identify if there is an intruder, or in the case of cleaning spaces, the robot has to clean all the ground it is moving through).

In the class, we'll define a procedure to capture the main points of the trajectory that the robot has to follow. Then, we will create a ROS program that calls the ROS Navigation Stack with those points, making the robot follow them in an endless loop.

You will receive the ROSject with the robot simulation, notebook with instructions, the map of the area already done, and all the launches required to start the navigation stack for the ROSbot.
- If you want to learn how to create the map, check our Live Class n.49: https://youtu.be/RknTTpga64s
- If you want to learn how to start the navigation system based on the map, check our previous Live Class n.50: https://youtu.be/4nctAuEaWbI

Robots used in this class:
- ROSbot 2.0 from Husarion (https://husarion.com/)

If you missed the class, you can find the ROSject files and full-code used in the class at the Robot Ignite Academy: https://www.robotigniteacademy.com

============================
Once a month at 18:00 CET/CEST. 

This is a monthly LIVE Class on how to develop with ROS and ROSbot 2.0. In Live Classes, you will practice with Ricardo Tellez from [ROSDS](http://www.theconstructsim.com/) at the same time that he explain, with the provided free ROS material.

IMPORTANT: Remember to be on time for the class because at the beginning of the class we will share the code with the attendants for free.

IMPORTANT 2: In order to start practicing quickly, we are using the ROS Development Studio for doing the practice. You will need a free account to attend the class. Go to http://rosds.online and create an account prior to the class.
